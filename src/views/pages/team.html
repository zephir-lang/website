                <p>
                    Andres is no stranger to open source projects. In the last nine years, he has designed and released frameworks for PHP and has been involved in web development - his main passion.
                    A TR35 winner, Andres' main drive is to always choose and implement or use the right tool for the job, mostly focused on performance. Therefore in 2011 a new idea was in the works; to create a new kind of framework for PHP developers, one that focuses on usability, features and mostly performance.
                    Through this new innovative approach Phalcon was born. A PHP framework written in C that can offer a wealth of features to developers while maximizing performance and keeping resource utilization low.
                    Andres is one of the core developers of Phalcon and its inspiration.
